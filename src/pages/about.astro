                <p>
                    <strong>Consult Your Community (CYC)</strong> is a national nonprofit consulting organization 
                    that inspires communities into actions. Through semester-long, skills-based consulting projects, 
                    we mobilize college students to leverage their education, digital fluency, 
                    mentorship networks, and knowledge as customers to empower businesses and drive change in their communities. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We provide <strong>pro bono consulting services</strong> to small
                    business owners and entrepreneurs in State College and surrounding
                    areas. Our services are customized to help clients overcome real-world
                    challenges—ranging from market research and brand strategy to operations,
                    digital presence, and customer outreach.

            </div>

            <p>
                Each semester, our student consultants form cross-functional
                teams to work directly with local business owners. Under the
                guidance of experienced mentors, they apply classroom knowledge
                to practical business scenarios—producing insights and
                strategies that help our clients grow and thrive.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the same time, CYC members gain invaluable professional
                experience, enhance their problem-solving skills, and build
                meaningful relationships with clients, alumni, and fellow
                consultants. We’re committed to creating a community where
                passion for service meets the power of innovation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether you’re a student looking to make an impact, or a
                business looking for support, CYC Penn State is here to build
                lasting partnerships that drive real change.
